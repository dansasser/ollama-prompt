### Architectural Comparison: `ollama-prompt` vs. Integrated Agent Systems

This document compares two distinct architectures for building multi-agent AI systems:

1.  **The Integrated "Black-Box" Model:** This refers to systems like Claude's native "sub-agent" feature, where the orchestration and delegation happen *internally* within a single, high-level model.
2.  **The Decoupled "Subprocess" Model:** This is an open architecture that any high-level agent (the "Orchestrator") can use. It relies on `ollama-prompt` to spawn and manage external, isolated worker processes ("Sub-Agents") to execute tasks locally.

`ollama-prompt` is the key enabler for this second, local-first model.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Integrated Model (e.g., Claude Sub-Agents) | Decoupled Model (via `ollama-prompt`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | **Monolithic & Integrated.** The main agent manages specialized "personalities" or "tools" internally. | **Decoupled & Explicit.** A main "Orchestrator" (any AI/script) spawns OS-level subprocesses. |
| **What is the "Sub-Agent"?** | A specialized, internal reasoning path managed by the primary model. | A **discrete `ollama-prompt` subprocess** that is created, executed, and terminated. |
| **Key Enabler** | A built-in, proprietary feature of the model itself. | The **`ollama-prompt` CLI tool**, which serves as a standardized "connector." |
| **Parallelism** | Managed internally ("black-box"). May or may not be truly parallel. | **True, OS-level parallelism.** The orchestrator can spawn multiple subprocesses simultaneously. |
| **Task Management** | The orchestrator delegates to an internal "skill." | The orchestrator executes a shell command and passes work via CLI flags (e.g., `@file`). |
| **Cost & Analytics** | Metrics may be provided by the model's API, but are often abstracted. | **Explicit & Structured.** Each subprocess returns a detailed **JSON receipt** (`eval_count`, `total_duration`). |
| **Transparency & Control** | Low ("black-box"). The developer trusts the orchestrator to manage its agents. | **High ("glass-box").** The developer has full control over the subprocess and gets auditable proof of its work. |
| **Best For** | Users who want a powerful, "all-in-one" solution without managing infrastructure. | Developers building local-first, auditable, or budget-aware AGI systems on *any* Ollama model. |

### Summary

The `ollama-prompt` tool is not just a simple prompt wrapper; it is a foundational component for a **decoupled, multi-agent architecture**.

It allows an Orchestrator (like Claude, a Python script, or a CI/CD pipeline) to treat any local Ollama model as a "Sub-Agent" by executing it as an isolated subprocess. This method provides two critical features that integrated systems obscure:

1.  **Explicit Analytics:** The structured JSON output is a "receipt" for the task, allowing the orchestrator to perform AGI-level reasoning about the "cost" (tokens, time) of its own actions.
2.  **True Parallelism:** The orchestrator can spin up multiple `ollama-prompt` workers simultaneously to parallelize tasks like code reviews across different files.
